## Problem

Current share dialog is functional but forgettable. A URL in an input field doesn't inspire sharing. Images get significantly better engagement on Twitter and Reddit.

---

## Solution

A shareable image template with native share sheet integration.

---

## Shareable Image Template

The image is a branded card (not the actual bracket) that creates curiosity:

- Knockout FPL branding/logo
- League name prominently displayed
- Current round ("Round of 16" / "Quarter Finals" / etc.)
- Participant count ("32 managers battling it out")
- Key stat if available ("Closest match: 2 points!")
- URL watermark at bottom

**Rationale:** A template scales to any tournament size, looks clean, and creates a reason to click through rather than showing everything upfront.

---

## Share Flow

1. User taps "Share" button (available on bracket view)
2. Modal shows preview of the shareable image
3. Two options:
   - **"Share Image"** - Downloads image or opens native share sheet with image attached
   - **"Copy Link"** - Fallback for quick link copying
4. Native share sheet handles Twitter/Reddit/WhatsApp routing

---

## Link Preview (OG Tags)

For when the link is pasted without an image:

- **Title:** "{League Name} Knockout Tournament"
- **Description:** "Round {X} - {N} managers remaining. See who's still standing."
- **Image:** Same generated template (or a static branded fallback)

---

## Components

### `ShareImagePreview`

- Canvas-rendered preview of the shareable image
- Download button (saves to device)
- Share button (native share sheet with image)
- Copy link fallback

### Updates to `ShareTournamentDialog`

- Replace current simple dialog with `ShareImagePreview`
- Keep copy-link as secondary action

---

## Implementation Notes

**Image generation:** Client-side with HTML Canvas for MVP. Server-side generation can come later if needed for OG image consistency.

**Target platforms:** Twitter, Reddit, WhatsApp. Native share sheet covers all three.

**Design asset needed:** Template layout with Knockout FPL branding, placeholder slots for dynamic content.

## Out of Scope

- Social-specific buttons (Twitter/Reddit/WhatsApp) - native share sheet handles routing
- Full bracket image generation - template is simpler and scales better
- Animated/video shares
