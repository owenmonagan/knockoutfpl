# Knockout FPL — Brand Guidelines

## The Philosophy

**We don't sell brackets. We sell the feeling of being in a cup final every single week.**

Every decision in this document — every color, every word, every interaction — should be measured against one question: *Does this make the stakes feel real?*

Fantasy Premier League has millions of players. They're already engaged. They're already competitive. But most of them feel nothing. They're in 47th place. They'll never catch the leader. There's no drama.

We give them drama. We give them stakes. We give them one opponent, one week, win or go home.

That's what we're selling.

---

## Brand Pillars

### 1. Stakes
Everything has consequences. You advance or you're eliminated. There's no "pretty good" — there's only survival. Our design and language should always remind users what's on the line.

### 2. Drama
Every matchup is a story. David vs. Goliath. Revenge matches. Cinderella runs. We're not displaying data — we're narrating competition.

### 3. Prestige
This isn't a casual game. It's a championship. The Champions League doesn't apologize for being elite, and neither do we. Deep blues, gold accents, the feeling of walking into a final.

### 4. Clarity
When the stakes are real, you need to see clearly. The bracket interface is clean, scannable, ruthlessly functional. The drama comes from the competition, not the UI.

---

## Voice & Tone

### We Sound Like
- A sports broadcaster who's slightly too excited
- The Champions League anthem in word form
- Your friend who takes the office league way too seriously (affectionately)
- A boxing promoter announcing the main event

### We Don't Sound Like
- A software product
- A help desk
- A terms of service document
- Someone who's apologizing

### Language Principles

**Visceral over informational.**
Not "You're winning 52-48" → "You're 4 points from elimination"

**Active over passive.**
Not "A tournament has been created" → "It's on."

**Stakes over status.**
Not "Round of 16" → "16 remain"

**Commands over suggestions.**
Not "You might want to share this" → "Bring your opponents"

### Word Bank

**Use freely:**
- Eliminated / Elimination
- Survive / Survival
- Advance
- Final / Finals
- Crown / Crowned
- Victory
- Knockout
- Sudden death
- On the line
- One shot
- Win or go home

**Use sparingly:**
- Congratulations
- Thank you
- Please
- Successfully
- Your request has been

**Never use:**
- Click here
- Submit
- Invalid
- Error occurred
- Oops

## Color System

### Philosophy
The color system operates in two contexts:
1. **The Arena** — Landing, marketing, celebration moments (prestigious, dramatic)
2. **The Bracket** — Tournament interface (clear, functional, stakes visible)

### Primary Brand Colors (The Arena)

| Color | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Midnight Blue** | `#0D1F3C` | 13, 31, 60 | Primary backgrounds, headers, navigation |
| **Deep Navy** | `#1A3A5C` | 26, 58, 92 | Secondary backgrounds, cards on dark |
| **Championship Gold** | `#C9A227` | 201, 162, 39 | CTAs, winners, advancement, glory |
| **Light Gold** | `#E8D5A3` | 232, 213, 163 | Hover states, subtle accents |

### Interface Colors (The Bracket)

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Bracket background — clarity is king |
| **Gray 50** | `#FAFAFA` | Page backgrounds |
| **Gray 100** | `#F5F5F5` | Cards, containers |
| **Gray 200** | `#E5E5E5` | Borders, dividers, connector lines |
| **Silver** | `#C0C0C0` | Runner-up, second place, eliminated paths |
| **Gray 500** | `#666666` | Secondary text, labels |
| **Near Black** | `#1A1A1A` | Primary text |

### Semantic Colors

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Victory Green** | `#28A745` | Wins, advancement confirmation |
| **Elimination Red** | `#DC3545` | Losses, elimination, danger |
| **Warning Amber** | `#FFC107` | Deadlines, close matches, tension |
| **Info Blue** | `#17A2B8` | Tips, neutral information |

### Critical Rules

⚠️ **Never use Gold (#C9A227) as text on white.** Contrast ratio is 2.1:1 (fails accessibility). Gold is for dark backgrounds or as fills with dark text.

⚠️ **Winner = Gold. Always.** Gold is reserved for champions, victories, advancement. Don't dilute it.

⚠️ **Eliminated = Dimmed, not deleted.** Eliminated teams get 50% opacity, but they stay visible. They're part of the story.

## Typography

### Type System

**Primary Font:** Inter
**Fallback:** -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif

### Type Scale

| Token | Size | Line Height | Weight | Usage |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| `display-xl` | 64px | 72px | 700 | Landing hero: "KNOCKOUT FPL" |
| `display-lg` | 48px | 56px | 700 | Section headlines, "IT'S ON." |
| `heading-1` | 32px | 40px | 600 | Page titles |
| `heading-2` | 24px | 32px | 600 | Card headers, round titles |
| `heading-3` | 20px | 28px | 600 | Subsections |
| `body-lg` | 18px | 28px | 400 | Lead paragraphs, taglines |
| `body` | 16px | 24px | 400 | Default body text |
| `body-sm` | 14px | 20px | 400 | Secondary info, metadata |
| `caption` | 12px | 16px | 400 | Labels, timestamps |
| `score` | 28px | 32px | 700 | Match scores — the most important number |

### Typography for Drama

**Scores are sacred.** The score is the biggest thing on a matchup card. It tells the story.

**ALL CAPS for moments.** "ELIMINATED." "VICTORY." "THE FINAL AWAITS." — these earn caps.

**Short sentences hit harder.** "You advance." beats "Congratulations on advancing to the next round!"

### Matchup Cards

The matchup card is our most important component. It tells the story of a fight.

**Anatomy:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ [Avatar] Team Name             52   │ │ ← Winner: gold left border
│ ├─────────────────────────────────────┤ │
│ │ [Avatar] Opponent              48   │ │ ← Loser: dimmed
│ └─────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                     4 pts from elimination │ ← Stakes, not status
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Specifications:**

**States:**

## Tournament Bracket Design

### Layout Principles

1. **Winners flow left to right.** The trophy is on the right.
2. **Connector lines show paths.** Gold for winners, gray for pending.
3. **User's path is highlighted.** They should instantly see where they are.
4. **Round headers tell the story.** "16 REMAIN" not "Round of 16"

### Round Headers

| Standard | Dramatic |
|----------|----------|
| Round of 32 | 32 REMAIN |
| Round of 16 | 16 REMAIN |
| Quarter-finals | 8 REMAIN |
| Semi-finals | 4 REMAIN |
| Final | THE FINAL |

### Connector Lines

- Stroke: 2px
- Default: Gray 200 (#E5E5E5)
- Winner's path: Gold (#C9A227)
- Corner radius: 4px
- Animation: Draw left-to-right on advancement (300ms, ease-out)

### The Champion

When someone wins the whole thing:
- Full-width celebration banner
- Gold everything
- Trophy icon prominent
- "CHAMPION" in display type
- Confetti (subtle, not obnoxious)

---

## Empty & Error States

### Empty States

Empty states are opportunities to build anticipation.

**No tournaments yet:**
```
        🏆
  No tournaments yet
 Your cup final is waiting.
   [Create Tournament]
```

**Waiting for opponents:**
```
        ⚔️
 Waiting for opponents
   0 of 32 spots filled
Share the link. Fill the bracket.
  [Invite Opponents]
```

### Error States

Errors should be direct, not apologetic.

**Team not found:**
```
    Team not found
Check your team name or ID and try again.
  [Where do I find my Team ID?]
```

**Something went wrong:**
```
   Something went wrong
We couldn't load the bracket. Try refreshing.
       [Refresh]
```

---

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints

| Token | Width | Bracket Behavior |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| `mobile` | < 640px | Round-by-round view, swipe navigation |
| `tablet` | 640-1024px | Horizontal scroll, collapsible rounds |
| `desktop` | 1024-1440px | Full bracket visible |
| `wide` | > 1440px | Max-width container (1280px), centered |

### Mobile Bracket

On mobile, you can't see the whole bracket. That's fine. Focus on:
1. User's current match (most prominent)
2. User's path to the final
3. Swipe to explore other matches

The drama is personal first, tournament-wide second.

### Touch Targets

⚠️ **Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements on mobile.** No exceptions.

---

## Accessibility

### Requirements

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- 4.5:1 contrast for normal text
- 3:1 contrast for large text
- 44x44px minimum touch targets
- Visible focus states (gold outline)
- No information by color alone

### Focus States

Focus ring: 2px Gold (#C9A227), 2px offset

**Never remove focus outlines.** Style them, don't hide them.

### Screen Reader Considerations

- Matchup cards: "[Team A] [score] versus [Team B] [score]. [Team A] is winning by [X] points."
- Round headers: "[X] teams remaining"
- Winner announcements: "[Team] has advanced to [Round]"

### Color Independence

Always pair color with another indicator:
- Winner: Gold border + checkmark icon
- Eliminated: Dimmed + "ELIMINATED" text
- Live: Green border + "LIVE" badge
- Error: Red border + error icon + text

---

## Logo Guidelines

### Primary Logo

The Knockout FPL logo combines bold typography with knockout tournament energy.

**Components:**
- Wordmark: "KNOCKOUT" in bold caps, "FPL" secondary
- Icon: Tournament bracket motif or stylized "K" (for small sizes)

### Clear Space

Minimum clear space = height of "K" in KNOCKOUT

### Variations

| Variant | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| Full color (Gold on Midnight) | Primary, marketing |
| Reversed (White on Midnight) | Headers, dark backgrounds |
| Monochrome (Navy on White) | Light backgrounds |
| Icon only | App icon, favicons |

### Don'ts

- Don't stretch or distort
- Don't use unapproved colors
- Don't add shadows or effects
- Don't place on busy backgrounds
