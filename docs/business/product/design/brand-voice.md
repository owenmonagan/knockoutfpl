# Knockout FPL — Guiding Principles

## We Don't Sell Brackets Here

---

### What We're Actually Selling

We are not selling knockout tournaments. We are not selling bracket software. We are not selling a better way to play Fantasy Premier League.

**We are selling the feeling of being in a cup final every single week.**

The product is the mechanism. The transformation is the sale.

### The Transformation

| Before Knockout FPL | After Knockout FPL |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Competing against 127 people (which means no one) | One opponent. You know their name. |
| Fun in August, tedious by December | Every gameweek matters until you're out |
| Chasing points you'll never catch | Win or go home |
| "I'm doing okay, I guess" | "Holy shit, I have to beat Dave this week" |

### Five Principles

**1. Stakes over features**

Never describe what the product does. Describe what it feels like. "Knockout tournaments" is a feature. "Win or go home" is a feeling.

**2. Drama is the product**

Every design decision, every word, every interaction should make the stakes feel real. If it doesn't add tension, cut it.

**3. Enemies, not users**

Your opponent isn't "User #4521." It's Dave from Accounting. We're not "inviting friends" — we're "bringing opponents." Language matters.

**4. Moments, not flows**

Onboarding isn't a funnel. It's a series of emotional beats. "You're already in the fight" should hit different than "You have 2 active tournaments."

**5. Earn the celebration**

When someone wins, it should feel like winning. When someone creates a tournament, they just started a war. Match the energy to the moment.

### The Litmus Test

Before shipping anything, ask:

> "Does this make the stakes feel real?"

If no, rethink it.

---

### Voice in Three Words

**Confident.** No hedging. "IT'S ON." not "Your tournament has been created!"

**Visceral.** "4 points from elimination" not "You're winning by 4."

**Competitive.** We're here to crown champions, not facilitate experiences.

### What We're Not

- We're not corporate. No "Thank you for signing up."
- We're not cute. No "Oops! Something went wrong 🙈"
- We're not neutral. We have a point of view: knockout football is better.

Make it so good they have to tell someone.
