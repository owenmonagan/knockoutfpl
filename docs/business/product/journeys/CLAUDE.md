# User Journeys

End-to-end user experiences. Validates that features work together as a coherent product.

## Purpose

Each journey doc shows:
- **The user's goal**
- **The steps they take (with feature references)**
- **What success looks like**
- **Where things can go wrong**

Journeys are the integration test for features. If a journey feels broken, a feature spec is missing something.
