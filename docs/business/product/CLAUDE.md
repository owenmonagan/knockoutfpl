# Product Documentation

Product specifications at a fidelity where an engineer never has to guess what to build or how it should behave.

---

## Purpose

These docs answer two questions:
1. **What does this feature do?** → See `features/`
2. **How do features connect into user experiences?** → See `journeys/`

If an engineer reads these docs and still has to guess, the docs have failed.

## Documents

- **[glossary.md](./glossary.md)** - Shared vocabulary. Read this first; all other docs use these terms.
- **[overview.md](./overview.md)** - Product scope, boundaries, and what's explicitly out of scope.
- **[design/](./design/CLAUDE.md)** - Brand voice, design system, and page specifications.
- **[features/](./features/CLAUDE.md)** - Detailed specs for each discrete capability. An engineer reads these to build.
- **[journeys/](./journeys/CLAUDE.md)** - End-to-end user experiences. Validates that features work together as a coherent product.
