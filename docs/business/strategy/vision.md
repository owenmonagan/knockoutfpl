# Vision

> **Status:** DRAFT - needs review and refinement

---

## Mission Statement (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Refine this to be more concise and memorable -->

Knockout FPL brings the excitement of knockout tournaments to Fantasy Premier League mini-leagues. We let FPL managers compete in bracket-style competitions with their existing teams.

---

## 3-Year Vision (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Define what success looks like in 3 years -->

- [ ] Become the go-to platform for FPL knockout competitions
- [ ] Support thousands of concurrent tournaments
- [ ] Be recognized in the FPL community as a trusted tool

---

## Core Beliefs (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Validate these assumptions -->

**Why this product needs to exist:**

1. **FPL is social but lacks head-to-head drama** - Mini-leagues are fun but the season-long format lacks the tension of knockout rounds
2. **Tournament formats are universally exciting** - March Madness, World Cup knockouts - people love bracket competitions
3. **Existing tools don't serve this need** - No simple way to run knockout tournaments for your mini-league

---

## Success Definition (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Make these more specific and measurable -->

**We've succeeded when:**

- FPL managers actively request Knockout FPL tournaments in their mini-leagues
- Tournament completion rates are high (people don't abandon mid-tournament)
- Users return season after season

**Metrics to track:**

- Tournaments created per gameweek
- Tournament completion rate
- User retention (season-over-season)
- Net Promoter Score

---

## Non-Goals (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Confirm these are still accurate -->

**What we explicitly won't do:**

- Replace FPL itself - we complement, not compete
- Live scoring during matches - too complex, use FPL for that
- Paid entry/prizes - legal complexity, not worth it initially
- Mobile app - web-first, mobile-responsive
