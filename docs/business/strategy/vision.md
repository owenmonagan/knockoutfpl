Why Knockout FPL exists and where we're headed.

---

## Mission

**Give FPL players something to play for every gameweek, regardless of their season.**

Mini-leagues reward 38-week consistency. That's great - but by December, half the players are out of contention with nothing but pride left. Knockout FPL fills the gap with tournament-style competition where your season rank doesn't matter.

## Core Beliefs

**The mini-league format is incomplete.**
FPL's native competition rewards season-long consistency. There's no built-in way to have high-stakes, short-form competition. Tournaments fill this gap.

**The FPL community is underserved.**
11+ million players, deeply engaged, yet few quality tools built specifically for them. The community deserves better.

**Community distribution beats paid marketing.**
FPL Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and podcasts spread good tools fast. Build something worth sharing; the community handles the rest.

**Tournaments and leagues are complementary, not competing.**
We're not replacing mini-leagues. We're adding the format that's been missing. Real football does both: the Premier League for season-long consistency, knockout cups (FA Cup, League Cup, Champions League) for elimination drama. FPL only has the league half.

## 3-Year Vision

**Knockout FPL is the default way FPL communities run tournament competitions.**

- Every FPL Discord server has an active knockout running
- Content creators host tournaments for their audiences
- "Let's run a knockout" is as natural as "let's start a mini-league"
- Thousands of tournaments active each season across mini-leagues, communities, and creator fandoms

## What Success Looks Like

**We've succeeded when:**
- Communities create tournaments without us prompting them
- Players return each season because the format is part of their FPL routine
- Content creators actively promote their Knockout FPL tournaments
- The product spreads through word-of-mouth alone

**We've failed if:**
- We have users but no community adoption (individuals, not groups)
- Growth stalls because communities aren't sharing it organically
- People try it once and don't return next season
