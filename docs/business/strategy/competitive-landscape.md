# Competitive Landscape

Who we're competing against and why we win.

## Market Reality

**The knockout tournament space for FPL is essentially empty.**

Despite 11+ million FPL players and a culture obsessed with competition, there's no established way to run knockout tournaments. The official FPL cup is poorly designed. Third-party tools focus on transfer optimization and live tracking, not tournaments. Manual alternatives don't exist in practice - people don't coordinate knockout brackets over spreadsheets.

**This means:**
- We're not displacing an incumbent
- We're creating a category, not competing in one
- The risk isn't losing to competitors - it's failing to prove demand exists

**Our real competition:**
1. **The official FPL cup** - Built-in but fundamentally broken
2. **Doing nothing** - The status quo for most mini-leagues
3. **FPL Pro Leagues** - Exists, offers knockouts, but not well-known

## The Official FPL Cup

The built-in FPL cup exists in two forms: the Overall Cup (all FPL players) and League Cups (within mini-leagues). Both have fundamental design problems.

### Overall FPL Cup

| Problem | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Dead teams** | Active managers regularly knocked out by abandoned teams with 8-10 players |
| **Random draw** | No seeding, no skill-based matchups - pure lottery |
| **Scale kills drama** | 8+ million entrants means you're facing strangers, not rivals |
| **Coin toss tiebreakers** | Tied scores decided by virtual coin flip |
| **Late qualification** | Starts GW16, but most get eliminated quickly with no storyline |

### Mini-League Cups

| Problem | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Starts absurdly late** | 16-person league = GW35 start. Only 4 gameweeks of competition. |
| **Misses the point** | Designed to end at GW38, not to re-engage mid-season dropouts |
| **No control** | Can't choose when it starts, how seeding works, or format |
| **Random draw** | Same lottery problem as Overall Cup |
| **Afterthought UX** | Buried in settings, no bracket visualization, minimal drama |

**Why this matters for us:**
The official cup doesn't solve mid-season disengagement. A 16-person league gets 4 weeks of knockout at season's end - precisely when engagement is already high. We solve the December problem, not the May problem.

## Third-Party Landscape

### FPL Pro Leagues

The only third-party offering knockout tournaments. Worth knowing about, but not a major threat.

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **What they offer** | Knockout cups, H2H, Champions League-style formats, automated reports |
| **Target user** | "League chairmen" - admins running large/paid leagues |
| **Positioning** | "Zero admin headaches" - selling convenience |
| **Reality** | Appears to be a manual service, not software. The founder *is* the automation. |

**Why they're not a major threat:**
- Not scalable - manual operation limits growth
- Targeting admins, not regular players
- Solving admin burden, not mid-season engagement
- Feature-heavy, complex for simple use cases
- Low awareness in the community

**If they come up:** We're actual software - self-serve, instant, scales infinitely. They're a done-for-you service with a person behind it.

### Other FPL Tools

None offer tournament creation. The ecosystem focuses on:
- **Live tracking:** LiveFPL, Live FPL Tables, Premier Fantasy Tools
- **Transfer optimization:** Fantasy Football Fix, FPL Review
- **Visualization:** fplGraphed, FPL Dashboard

These are complementary, not competitive. Users might use LiveFPL for live scores AND Knockout FPL for tournaments.

## Our Differentiation

**We win by being the opposite of what exists.**

| Dimension | Official FPL Cup | FPL Pro Leagues | Knockout FPL |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Timing** | End of season only | Anytime (manual setup) | Anytime, instant |
| **Control** | None | Some | Full |
| **Complexity** | Buried in settings | Feature-heavy | One-minute setup |
| **Target** | Everyone (random) | League admins | Mini-league members |
| **Scalability** | N/A | Manual, limited | Software, unlimited |
| **Core promise** | "There's a cup" | "We'll handle it" | "Something to play for" |

**Our positioning in one line:**
Create a knockout tournament for your mini-league in under a minute. Scores pulled automatically. Drama guaranteed.

## Risks

### FPL Builds Something Better

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Likelihood** | Low |
| **Impact** | Critical |
| **Our take** | The official cup has been neglected for years. FPL's priorities are elsewhere (ads, sponsorships, core game). If they suddenly ship a great knockout feature, we've learned the market exists - pivot or exit gracefully. |

**Mitigation:** Move fast, build community loyalty, become the default before they react.

### FPL API Changes or Blocks

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Likelihood** | Medium |
| **Impact** | Critical |
| **Our take** | The unofficial API has been stable for years. Many tools depend on it. But we have no fallback if it breaks. |

**Mitigation:** Cache aggressively, monitor API health, build relationships with other tool makers who'd have early warning.

### FPL Pro Leagues Gets Traction

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Likelihood** | Low |
| **Impact** | Low-Medium |
| **Our take** | Manual service can't scale. If they grow, they'll hit capacity limits. We're playing a different game. |

**Mitigation:** None needed. Stay focused on our positioning.

### Nobody Wants This

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Likelihood** | Medium |
| **Impact** | Critical |
| **Our take** | The biggest risk. We believe knockout format appeals to FPL players, but it's unvalidated. |

**Mitigation:** r/FantasyPL mega tournament tests this at scale, fast.
