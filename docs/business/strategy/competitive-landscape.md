# Competitive Landscape

> **Status:** DRAFT - needs research and validation

---

## Direct Competitors (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Research these more thoroughly -->

| Competitor | What They Do | Our Differentiation |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| *None identified yet* | | |

**Notes:**
- FPL head-to-head tools exist but focus on 1v1, not tournaments
- Most mini-league tools are for draft leagues, not classic FPL

---

## Indirect Alternatives (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Understand how people solve this today -->

**What do people do today?**

| Solution | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Spreadsheets | Flexible, familiar | Manual, error-prone, tedious |
| WhatsApp/Discord | Social, easy | No automation, easy to forget |
| Don't do it | Zero effort | Miss out on fun |

---

## Our Differentiation (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Validate these are actually differentiators -->

**Why choose Knockout FPL?**

1. **Automatic** - Scores pulled from FPL, no manual entry
2. **Integrated** - Works with your existing mini-league
3. **Simple** - Create a tournament in under a minute
4. **Free** - No cost, no ads (for now)

## Risks (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Prioritize and plan mitigations -->

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| FPL API changes/blocks | Medium | Critical | Monitor API, cache aggressively, have fallback |
| Official FPL adds this feature | Low | Critical | Move faster, build community, differentiate |
| Low adoption | Medium | High | Focus on viral loops within mini-leagues |
| Firebase costs grow | Low | Medium | Monitor usage, optimize queries |
