# Strategy Documentation

Why Knockout FPL exists, our market position, and where we're headed.

---

## Purpose

These docs serve **team alignment** and **product decisions** - not investor pitches. They should be:
- **Concise** - Quick to read and reference
- **Actionable** - Help make consistent decisions
- **Honest** - Capture real beliefs, not aspirational positioning

When in doubt, optimize for clarity over polish.
