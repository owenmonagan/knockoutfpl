# Business Model

> **Status:** DRAFT - needs validation and expansion

## Value Proposition (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Refine based on user feedback -->

| For | Who | We Provide | Unlike |
|-----|-----|------------|--------|
| FPL mini-league members | Want more excitement from their league | Bracket-style knockout tournaments | Spreadsheets, WhatsApp tracking |
| FPL mini-league organizers | Want to engage their members | Easy tournament creation | Manual bracket management |

**Pain we solve:**
- Season-long leagues can feel stale mid-season
- No easy way to run knockout competitions
- Manual tracking is tedious and error-prone

**Gain we create:**
- Excitement of knockout drama
- Bragging rights and clear winners
- Automatic scoring and progression

## Customer Segments (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Validate these personas with real users -->

**Primary: FPL Mini-League Members**
- Already play FPL
- Part of 1+ mini-leagues (friends, work, family)
- Want more engagement beyond season standings

**Secondary: Mini-League Organizers**
- Create and manage mini-leagues
- Looking for ways to keep members engaged
- Often the "commissioner" type

## Channels (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Prioritize and plan these -->

**How users find us:**

- [ ] Word of mouth within mini-leagues
- [ ] FPL Twitter/X community
- [ ] FPL Reddit (r/FantasyPL)
- [ ] FPL podcasts and content creators

## Key Activities (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Prioritize these -->

**What we must do well:**

1. **Reliable FPL data** - Scores must be accurate
2. **Bracket logic** - Seeding, byes, progression must work correctly
3. **Simple UX** - Create tournament in < 1 minute
4. **Mobile experience** - Most FPL users are on mobile

---

## Key Resources (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Document costs and dependencies -->

**What we need:**

- FPL API access (public, unofficial)
- Firebase infrastructure (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Hosting)
- Domain name
- Development time

---

## Revenue Streams (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Decide if/when to monetize -->

**Current:** None (free to use)

**Future possibilities:**
- [ ] Premium features (advanced stats, unlimited tournaments)
- [ ] Sponsored tournaments
- [ ] Donations/tips
- [ ] Partnerships with FPL content creators

**Explicitly not pursuing (for now):**
- Paid entry / prize pools (legal complexity)
- Advertising (degrades experience)

---

## Cost Structure (DRAFT)

<!-- TODO: Track actual costs -->

| Cost | Estimate | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Firebase (Spark plan) | $0 | Free tier sufficient initially |
| Domain | ~$15/year | |
| Development time | N/A | Side project |
